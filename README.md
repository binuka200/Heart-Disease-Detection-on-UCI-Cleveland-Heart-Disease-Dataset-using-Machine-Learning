# Heart-Disease-Detection-on-UCI-Cleveland-Heart-Disease-Dataset-using-Machine-Learning


Heart Disease is one of the most debilitating disease that can affect a person and it is also the reason for the highest number of deaths annually. Therefore, detecting heart disease is vital and the current approach is for doctors to examine the feature blood sugar, cholesterol to determine if the person has the disease or not. This method is prone to human error and it can have a devastating effect on the patient. Therefore, this project aims to develop 3 machine learning models namely Support Vector Machine, Random Forest model and a Deep Neural Network model to do heart disease detection autonomously using the appropriate features thus aiding doctors to make a decision.
The models are built using the UCI Cleveland Heart Disease dataset. The data will undergo pre-processing, visualization, feature selection and hyperparameter tuning to train and test these 3 models. Support Vector machine model obtained the highest accuracy out of all 3 models with 90.4% in detecting heart disease using this dataset while Random Forest and Deep Neural Network both had an accuracy of 89.2% in detection.
